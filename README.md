# Introduction to Programming Techniques Using a Simplified Interactive Game Development Experience 
## Description
* Difficulty Level: Beginner
* Target Audience: 6th grade - College
* Duration of Workshop: 1 hour 
* Needed Materials: Computers, Makey Makey, and conductive materials such as bananas and Play-Doh modeling compound.
* Learning outcomes: The two primary goals of this project is teaching the students the basics of Scratch and giving them a crash course on algorithms.
* Scratch is a block-based programming language developed by the MIT Media Lab as an educational tool for children. Through our classroom workshops and outreach activities, students get to learn how to program character movement and sprite animation in Scratch, using the fundamental programming concepts such as variables, if-else statements, and loops. These experiences will help them develop problem-solving and logical reasoning skills that can be applied to other programming languages as well as other fields outside of computing. Through this project, we hope to increase interest and participation in STEM; and show that learning how to program can be fun and creative.
* [TAP](https://ggc.edu/academics/school-of-science-and-technology/research-internships-service-learning/technology-ambassador-program) (Technology Ambassadors Program) is a project-based class that provides a collaborative environment for students to work with their fellow classmates on a semester-long project using technologies of their choice. TAP strives to increase participation in IT through numerous outreach activities and workshops that are designed to showcase the creative and fun side of technology.

### Scratch
<img src = "Media/Technology/scratch logo.png" width="200" height="200">

* [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) is a block-based programming language developed by the MIT Media Lab as an education tool for children to learn computing in a fun and interactive way.
* Scratch has drag-and-drop interfaces. Unlike working with a text-based programming language like Java or C whom you must physically type every line of code, in Scratch, you can drag and drop pre-made codes and organize them into an algorithm. It's like solving a jigsaw puzzle!
* We picked Scratch for our project because it's a fun medium to teach beginners about programming without overwhelming them with syntax. In fact, our space-themed game is entirely built in Scratch.

### Makey Makey
* [Makey Makey](https://makeymakey.com/) is a tool set that lets you create a controller using conductive materials to complete the circuit. For our project, we mainly use bananas and Play-Doh, but other conductive materials such as aluminum foil and citrus will also work.
